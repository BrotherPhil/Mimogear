> A dead simple static site generator and web development framework

##What is Mimogear?

**Mimogear is a simple static site generator and web development framework** that will _automatically compile, distribute, and watch development assets_. Under the hood, Mimogear uses **gulp**, a popular task runner, **pug** a powerful html template engine, **postcss** a css post-processer, and simply javascript.

##Why Mimogear?

After looking through all the cool static site generators out there, you may have realized that they are fairly complex. Mimogear aims to be the simplest static site generator out there while balancing a useful feature set.

##Highlights

* Full asset compilation, distribution, and watch
* Complete pug framework for generating html files
* Clean skeleton postcss framework for quick style development
* Thoroughly tested javascript components

##Installation

Mimogear uses node package manager in order to download all of the necessary build dependencies. If you haven't downloaded node before, head over to [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to download the latest version of node. Once you've installed node and have downloaded Mimogear, let's `cd` into the project directory and then download our dependencies using the a terminal:

```sh
cd <folder-of-Mimogear> (drag the folder into your terminal)
npm install
gulp
```

After that your project will open up in a browser window automatically and you're ready to get started in developing html/pug, css/postcss, and javascript. Head over to /src/ to see your shiny new development framework! If you're feeling stuck, check out [/docs/](https://github.com/mimoduo/Mimogear/tree/master/docs).
