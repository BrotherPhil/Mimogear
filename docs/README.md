#Quickstart

Mimogear was built to be simple. In those regards, this installation will be simple as well, not to mention quick.

##Installation

Mimogear uses npm in order to scaffold all of the necessary dependencies. To get started, let's cd into the project directory and then download our dependencies using the a terminal.

```sh
cd <folder-of-Mimogear>
npm install
```

##Updating Configuration

Now that you've downloaded all of the dependencies, let's take a moment to setup any variables that will help theme your site. Within the root of Mimogear, you'll find a list of variables within configuration.js. If you just want to dive in, move down to "Running Gulp".

##Running Gulp

The meat of Mimogear is the "gulp" command. Within your terminal, type in _gulp_ to help process a distribution (dist) folder for your site.

```sh
gulp
```

This will automatically open your browser to your site and also watch for any file changes in the source (src) folder. Now get to it, developer!
