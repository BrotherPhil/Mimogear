#Gulp

##Usage

Once you're all [setup](https://github.com/mimoduo/Mimogear/tree/master/docs), there is the `gulp` command to get you started. This command will compile all files into the /dist/ folder, open a new browser window with your site, and begin watching the files within the /src/ folder. In other words, the ultimate static site generator command.

```sh
gulp
```

Sometimes you may want to build only a particular set of files or watch without building. In that case, there are several commands you can run.

```sh
gulp pug
gulp postcss
gulp js
gulp images
gulp sprite
gulp watch
```
