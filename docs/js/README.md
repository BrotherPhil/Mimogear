#JS

Standard JS was chosen, rather than a JS based framework like jquery, for its community support and to reduce the number of dependencies required by Mimogear. Each module uses the module pattern as detailed by the [Oneone project](https://github.com/mimoduo/Oneone) and written about at [css-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/how-do-you-structure-javascript-the-module-pattern-edition/).
