#Components

Components refer to custom modules that are developed during production.

##Logo

The logo component is an anchor used to house your site's logo. The default setup includes the logo as an svg symbol however, it can also be used in conjunction with an img element or a background image. The label indicating the name of the site is visually hidden but visible to screen readers. This prevents the text from getting in the way of the logo's dimensions.

##Search

The search component contains selectors for the default pug search partial that isn't integrated into any particular platform. The label is visually hidden by default. The site search button styles reflect the submit input at the end of the search form.
