#Regions

Regions are common structural elements that are included on every page by default. Certain regions also contain several helpful blocks the can be used on a page by page basis. Information on customizing the available region blocks can be found within the [pug/pages](https://github.com/mimoduo/Mimogear/blob/master/docs/pug/pages.md) documentation.

While there are no blocks present within the head region, there may be cases where using a block in your project may be useful. Maybe certain pages will need to have different types of navigation or different spotlight images. Keep this in mind while developing your site!
