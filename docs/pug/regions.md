#Regions

Regions are common structural elements that are included on every page.

##Footer

The footer region contains the footer html element, an address partial, the main javascript file, and a block to pass in any additional scripts if necessary. More information on customizing these blocks on a page by page basis can be found within the [pug/pages](https://github.com/mimoduo/Mimogear/blob/master/docs/pug/pages.md) documentation.

##Head

The head region contains a title and description block, standard meta elements, favicon starter, the main stylesheet, and an optional block to pass in more stylesheets if necessary. More information on customizing these blocks on a page by page basis can be found within the [pug/pages](https://github.com/mimoduo/Mimogear/blob/master/docs/pug/pages.md) documentation.

##Header

The header region contains the drawer and your site's logo.
